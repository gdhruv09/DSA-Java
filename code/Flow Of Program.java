## Create pseudocode for the following:

1. Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not.

Start 
Input year
If (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 ! = 0 || year % 400 = 0)
output "Leap Year"
exit
else output "Not Leap Year"
Exit 

2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.

Start
Input Number1 
Input Number2
sum = Number1 + Number2
Output (sum)
exit

3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.

start 
input number 
for (int i=0; i<=10; i++>)
output (number)
Stop

4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.

start
input number1
input number2 
While (HCF>1)
HCF = number1 % number2
output (HCF)
end while
Lcm = num1*num2/hcf
Output (LCM)
Stop

5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters ‘x’, after that print sum of all.

start
input number
while (input=x)
if input == x;
break
else sum = sum + number
output "sum"
Stop
